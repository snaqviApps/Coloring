# branch - main updated with recyclerView 

- that shows the recyclerView- under the color - text
- has navigation to detailed view when clicked on any of the items in the list  
- once in the detail-view (fragment), there is a black button that is for navigating back to main View
- details need to be enhanced like scores for exam, as well as back-navigation inline with system-based and backstack-management
