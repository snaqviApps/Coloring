# Coloring


# branch - main updated with recyclerView 

- that shows the recyclerView- under the color - text
- has navigation to detailed view when clicked on any of the items in the list  
- once in the detail-view (fragment), there is a black button that is for navigating back to main View
- details need to be enhanced like scores for exam, as well as back-navigation inline with system-based and backstack-management
# features added : 
## UIStates utilization to manage the States, update the liveData 
## Coroutines and Dependency Injection using Dagger

# back-Navigation implemented ##
when user is on main-schools list, the bottom-navigation (schools) icon would be indigo. Soon user moves to details screen the bottom navigation icon would turn greyed, but still clickable. if user clicks on the greyed-icon, it will take user back to main-schools - list (main list). The top activity keeps on the front and stays interactable
